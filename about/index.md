## About this website

This is my personal website doubling as a sharing hub for things that interest
me.

Instead of using multiple apps to share notes, bookmarks, feeds, etc., I
collect it all here to make it available in all my browsers, devices, friends,
family, and whoever stumbles upon it while traversing the Web.

I'm using [GitHub's](https://docs.github.com/) [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
[integration](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
to turn a collection of .md files into simple pages and occasionally fall back
to .html for more complex stuff. This let's me write notes in my notes app and
export it here to turn into a webpage.

## About me

My name is Guido Schlabitz. I'm a software enthusiast from Germany living in the US.

Here I am in my very first hours of writing code, probably in the year 1986.
