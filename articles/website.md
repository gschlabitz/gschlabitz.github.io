title: Free Personal Website
---

A central public place to collect

- favorite links I often access in a browser
- notes about useful stuff I want to (re-)remember later

Simpler than making multiple accounts on multiple services and keeping them updated and synchronized between my devices.

## Free Hosting

Many free website hosting services exist. I like Github, because updating a website i similar to updating a software project.
Create a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com) then follow the [Quickstart for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) instructions to make your own personal and free website!
