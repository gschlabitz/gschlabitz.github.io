title: Guido Schlabitz - Life Hacks

I often made my life harder than it had to be. When I finally discovered or read
about a better solution to everyday problems, I smacked my forehead and
exclaimed: _"Why didn't I think of this before??"_

To save you some time and forehead pain, here is a collection of useful hacks
that helped me in my life.

## Host your personal website for free

Create a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com) then follow the
[Quickstart for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
instructions. That's how I made this website!

## Track your finances and budget for free

I've used many personal finance tools over the years, for example:

- [MS Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Money)
- [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com/)
- [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/)
- [Gnu Cash](https://www.gnucash.org/)
- [Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount)

They all had similar problems: you had to learn their particular quirks, the
data entry interface was inefficient or unintuitive, features were missing or
half-baked, importing transactions was a chore, they pushed bank products I'm
not interested in, etc.

I finally settled on using spreadsheets. You can create your budget exactly the
way you like it. You can change your mind about your accounting processes at any
time and create more sheets with a different perspective on the raw data.

Speaking of raw data, all banks export transactions to CSV files. There is no
_"can't import this file version"_ error here. There is no _"we don't have this
feature, but we're planning on implementing it real soon!"_ **I'm so much
happier with the family budget spreadsheet I puttered together over time!**

**_Bonus:_** You learn advanced spreadsheet skills that come in handy for many
jobs! I personally use [Pages](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pages/id409201541),
as it came free with my Mac, but if you have free access to
[Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel), I would recommend
that, especially if you're keen on padding your job skills.

## Sync bookmarks between browsers

To collect bookmarks, share them with people, and keep your collection
synchronized between devices, you could use a tool like
[Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) or a [browser
extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/search/synchronize%20bookmarks).

**Or** you can make your own webpage of links! No fuss, no muss! Add your links
to the page, categorize them the way you like, maybe even add some notes. Then
publish the page on your website and everyone is up to date. Your friends and
your browsers can all access it easily. There is really no need for a database
here!
