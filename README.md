# Personal Website

This is my personal website doubling as a sharing hub for things I'm interested
in. Instead of using multiple apps to share notes, bookmarks, feeds, etc., I'll
collect it all here and it will be available in all my browsers, on my devices,
to friends and family or whoever finds it via search. Yay, World Wide Web.

I'm using [GitHub's](https://docs.github.com/) [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
[integration](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
to turn a collection of .md files into simple pages and occasionally fall back
to .html for more complex stuff. This let's me write notes in my notes app and
export it here to turn into a webpage.
