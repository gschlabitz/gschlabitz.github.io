# Personal Website

This is my personal website sharing knowledge I've accumulated with the world. I'm using GitHub's Jekyll integration to turn a collection of .md files into simple pages and occasionally fall back to .html for more complex stuff.

## Credits

I designed and wrote everything myself, except for the below:

Color Palette by [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/).
Icons by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

## TODO

- [ ] Add https://theoatmeal.com/
- [ ] Find a SSG tool for MD -> HTML
- [ ] add [Antje's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/travel2live.de)
- [ ] Use [markwhen](https://markwhen.com/) to create live event/places lived/workplaces timelines
