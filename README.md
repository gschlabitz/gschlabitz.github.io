# Personal Website

This is my personal website sharing knowledge I've accumulated with the world.
It's also a love letter to the Holy Web Trinity of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), i.e. the stuff that's built-in.
No framework opinions, no pre, mid, and post-processing, just whatever [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) says is supported by most browsers.
I might add some tools for convenience later, e.g. a [static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev/) to add fragments/includes.

## Credits

I designed and wrote everything myself, except for the below:
