title: Life Hacks - Sync bookmarks between browsers
---

To collect bookmarks, share them with people, and keep your collection
synchronized between devices, you could use a tool like
[Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) or a [browser
extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/search/synchronize%20bookmarks).

**Or** you can make your own webpage of links! No fuss, no muss! Add your links
to the page, categorize them the way you like, maybe even add some notes. Then
publish the page on your website and everyone is up to date. Your friends and
your browsers can all access it easily. There is really no need for a database
here!
